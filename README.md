# TordzBotAntiMalware Documentation

TordzBotAntiMalware is a command-line tool designed to scan files and directories for potential malicious code patterns. It provides a simple and efficient way to detect suspicious code snippets and identify possible security vulnerabilities in your codebase.

## Features

- Powerful Malicious Code Detection: TordzBotAntiMalware uses an extensive set of predefined malicious code patterns to scan files and directories. It can detect common security threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and more.

- Directory and File Scanning: You can scan individual files or entire directories by specifying the path as a command-line argument. TordzBotAntiMalware will recursively scan all files in the specified directory, providing a comprehensive analysis of your codebase.

- Log Generation: The tool generates a detailed log file (`log.txt`) that records the scan results, including the detected suspicious patterns in each scanned file. The log file helps you track and review the scan results for further analysis or reference.

- Interactive User Interface: TordzBotAntiMalware provides a user-friendly command-line interface that guides you through the scanning process. It displays progress updates, scan animations, and colored output to highlight suspicious patterns and scan results.
